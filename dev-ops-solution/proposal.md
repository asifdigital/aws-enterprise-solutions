# AWS Infrastructure Modernization Proposal

## Executive Summary

Client XYZ is seeking to modernize its AWS infrastructure and DevOps capabilities across development, test, and production environments. This phased engagement is designed to assess the existing footprint, define a target-state architecture aligned with AWS best practices, and implement a secure, scalable, observable, and automated environment using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC).

## Engagement Scope

The engagement includes four structured phases:

---

### Phase 1: Discovery & AS-IS State Assessment

#### Activities:
- Conduct architecture and operations workshops.
- Audit existing AWS infrastructure, tooling, and CI/CD pipelines.
- Document AS-IS state across networking, security, observability, and automation.
- Identify cost optimization opportunities.

#### Deliverables:
- Signed-off AS-IS documentation.
- Gap analysis and solution diagram.

---

### Phase 2: TO-BE Design and Planning

#### Activities:
- Define target AWS architecture (multi-AZ, HA, cost-efficient).
- Plan IaC using Terraform and Terragrunt (modular and DRY).
- Design CI/CD strategy (Jenkins hardening or GitHub Actions).
- Define monitoring modernization path (AMP, AMG).

#### Deliverables:
- TO-BE architecture diagrams.
- CI/CD and tooling recommendations.
- Signed-off implementation plan.

---

### Phase 3: Implementation & Environment Modernization

#### Activities:
- Develop reusable Terraform modules.
- Set up environment isolation for dev/test/prod.
- Modernize CI/CD pipelines with gated approvals.
- Implement observability stack (Grafana, Prometheus, CloudWatch).
- Harden operational tooling and tagging strategy.

#### Deliverables:
- Infrastructure deployed across environments.
- Fully automated CI/CD pipelines.
- Application and infrastructure dashboards.

---

### Phase 4: Finalization, Documentation & Handover

#### Activities:
- Handover and training sessions for developers and ops teams.
- Knowledge transfer for platform management, security, and cost control.

#### Deliverables:
- Operations runbooks and knowledge base.
- Training recordings and onboarding material.
- Support model recommendations.

## Technical Domains in Scope
- AWS Architecture (multi-AZ, HA, cost-optimized)
- Terraform IaC + Terragrunt
- CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, AWS Code*)
- Monitoring (AMP, AMG, CloudWatch)
- Security (IAM, WAF, audit trails, Secrets Manager)
- Environment isolation and tagging
- Developer experience enhancement

## Technologies Addressed
- Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Kong API Gateway
- Angular (served via S3/CloudFront)
- Jenkins, Bitbucket or GitHub
- Prometheus, Grafana
- EC2, ALB, Route 53, WAF, IAM, SNS

## Value Delivered
- Documented current and target-state architecture.
- Reusable Terraform modules for full lifecycle automation.
- Hardened and standardized CI/CD pipelines.
- Modern observability with real-time metrics and alerts.
- Secure, scalable, and cost-efficient environments.
- Developer enablement and team upskilling.

## Team Composition
- Senior Solutions Architect
- Technical Project Manager
- AWS Consultant
- DevOps Engineer

---

## Notes
- This engagement assumes enhancements over an existing AWS footprint.
- Major replatforming (e.g., containers, multi-region) is excluded unless separately scoped.
- Terraform code accompanying this proposal demonstrates modular structure, reusable across environments, and supports automated deployments.
